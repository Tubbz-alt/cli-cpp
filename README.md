# CLI-C++ #

A Command-Line Interface (CLI) for use in C++ programs.

## Overview ##

The purpose of this project is to provide C++ programmers with a Command-Line Interface which they can 
tie into their existing projects.  This seeks to allow connecting to your application via the local 
process or via a TCP socket.  

All arguments are controlled via a configuration file which consists of several CLI commands plus the user-defined
commands.  The command name, arguments, types, and response expectations can be provided.
